# Tempura mining

### Miner 1: ntgbtminer :hammer:

ntgbtminer is a no thrills
[getblocktemplate](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Getblocktemplate) Bitcoin miner.
It is not performant, but demonstrates basic use of the getblocktemplate
protocol for a standalone Bitcoin miner. It has no dependencies outside of
standard Python libraries and a JSON-HTTP connection to your local Bitcoin
daemon.

The following changes has been made w.r.t. to the Bitcoin version of the miner:

* adding Peercoin transaction timestamp
* using P2PK for coinbase transactions instead of P2PKH like in the first Peercoin coinbase blocks
* adding empty block signature at the end of the block to avoid "Block decode failed" error from peercoind

Forked from: [vsergeev/ntgbtminer](https://github.com/vsergeev/ntgbtminer.git)

To initialize the miner, move into this repo and type the following command:

```sh
RPC_USER=any_username RPC_PASS=any_password RPC_URL="http://127.0.0.1:9904" \
    python3 ntgbtminer.py "Random useless message" \
    "03ee5e86bad451416d8be66c4c08e980fc90d5003e4bc5026026e295f039fb9064"
```

where the last parameter is the public key and not the address.

### Miner 2: generatetoaddress :hammer:

A simple alternative to start mining is the following commmand for bitcoin-cli, that triggers a simple CPU miner and successfully mines blocks in regtest mode and testnet (not tried in mainnet):

```sh
peercoin-cli generatetoaddress <N_OF_BLOCKS> <ADDR_TO_GET_REWARD> <MAX_TRIES>
```


### Mined block structure

The following is the analysis of the parameters of a generic Bitcoin/Peercoin block containing only a single coinbase transaction (this particular one is block 3 of the Peercoin Testnet):

Parameter | Hex | Bytes
------- | --------- | ------
Version | 01000000 | 4
Previous block hash | 6c5fa7bf58277ca33ee5c459b7e2a7a30df7a71c0f54b2c96931861205000000 | 32

N. of transactions | 01 | needed
Transactions | single_coinbase_transaction | needed

A block can be obtained by running this command: 

```
peercoin-cli getblock $(peercoin-cli getblockhash <BLOCK_HEIGHT>) <VERBOSITY>
```

with verbosity set to 0 if you want the hexadecimal version of the block.

Here we have the **coinbase transaction** contained in the block described above. \
A coinbase transaction is the one that gives a reward to the miner after computing a valid hash for the block. The input of the transaction is empty because coins are not taken from an older unspent transaction, but basically are generated out of thin air. \
Usually after the coinbase tx are included all the other transactions that needs to be validated, however this was one of the first blocks of the chain and was only mined to generate the first coins.

Parameter | Hex | Bytes

**Locktime** | 00000000 | 4

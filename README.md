# ntgbtminer :hammer:

ntgbtminer is a no thrills Bitcoin miner.
It is not performant, but demonstrates basic use of the `getblocktemplate`
protocol for a standalone Bitcoin miner. It has no dependencies outside of
standard Python libraries and a JSON-HTTP connection to your local Bitcoin
daemon.

### Changes

The following changes has been made w.r.t. to the Bitcoin version of the miner:

* adding Peercoin transaction timestamp
* using [P2PK](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/p2pk) for coinbase transactions instead of [P2PKH](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/p2pkh)
* adding empty block signature at the end of the block to avoid "Block decode failed" error from peercoind

### Setup

To initialize the miner, move into this repo and type the following in your shell:

```sh
RPC_USER=any_username RPC_PASS=any_password RPC_URL="http://127.0.0.1:9904" \
    python3 ntgbtminer.py "<RANDOM_MESSAGE>" "<PUB_KEY>"
```

It is possible to get the public key associated to an address using `getaddressinfo`.

### Mined block structure

The following is the analysis of the parameters of a generic [Bitcoin block](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/block-header) containing only a single coinbase transaction (this particular one is block 3 of Peercoin Testnet):

Parameter | Hex | Bytes
------- | --------- | ------
Version | 01000000 | 4
Previous block hash | 6c5fa7bf58277ca33ee5c459b7e2a7a30df7a71c0f54b2c96931861205000000 | 32

Timestamp | 19cc3a50 | 4
Difficulty | 41fc071d | 4
Nonce | 2d25990b | 4
N. of transactions | 01 | needed
Transactions | single_coinbase_transaction | needed
Signature size | 23 | needed
Block signature | 304502205e76ed4e6d5e54771a750116968b79bc390d55af04 d0fd88a4cc7ce12129fa2b022100aa7cb078d805bfa8ac7563a5 bd7645808516be69972da0f375dbeaf968ba1a09 | needed


A block can be obtained by running this command: 

```
peercoin-cli getblock $(peercoin-cli getblockhash <BLOCK_HEIGHT>) <VERBOSITY>
```

with verbosity set to 0 if you want the hexadecimal version of the block.

### PoW coinbase tx

Here we have the [coinbase transaction](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/coinbase-transaction) that is contained in the block described above. \
A coinbase is the tx that gives a reward to the miner after computing an hash for a new block. The input of the transaction is empty because coins are not taken from an older unspent transaction, but basically are generated out of thin air. \
Usually after the coinbase tx are included all the other transactions that needs to be validated, however this was one of the first blocks of the chain and was only mined to generate the first coins.

Parameter | Hex | Bytes
------- | --------- | ------
**Version** | 01000000 | 4
**Timestamp** (Peercoin only) | f9c83a50 | 4
**N. of inputs** | 01 | needed

Sequence | ffffffff | 4
**N. of outputs** | 01 | needed
Output amount | c022eff401000000 | 8
Script pub key size | 23 | needed
Script pub key (P2PK) | 21033745c638d520c6cd46c5fbdb319dfe6d8df5f83431d8b3997f7b097bfdfae2eeac | needed
**Locktime** | 00000000 | 4

# generatetoaddress :hammer:

A simple alternative to start mining is `generatetoaddress` commmand for bitcoin-cli, that triggers a simple CPU miner and successfully mines blocks in regtest mode and testnet:

```sh
peercoin-cli generatetoaddress <N_OF_BLOCKS> <ADDR_TO_GET_REWARD> <MAX_TRIES>
```

For additional info check this thread [Bitcointalk - latest bitcoin still support mining?](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5227792.0&utm_source=pocket_mylist).

**Warning:** coinbase transactions mined with this command seems not to be supported from Peercoin for minting purposes.
